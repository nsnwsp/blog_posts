So she was considering in her\n            own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very\n            sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain\n            would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,\n            when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There\n            was nothing so very remarkable in that;\n          "
